### About me
*Currently, I am studying at 42Bangkok school.* I enjoy using programming or many tools that are related to technology. Each tool has its limitations, so I need to understand more about how each tool works.
It made me improve more about the adaptive skills that I have. When I was a student in college, I had some business concepts. That's why I am interested in data roles.
I hope my sharing some sources might be helpful. who knows??? My sources will be old in the next day next month even next year. At least, I'll never stop learning new things that coming to our world.
# Hello world!!!!!!
This is what programmers usually say right!!!!
I think I am in data roles, but right now I am also the programmer.
And you can be anything also, so don't give up I understand y'all feelings for imposter syndrome.
# We can be anything!!!!! Don't let anyone judge y'all life!!!!
At least, to improve your life graph will tell the truth!!!!!

### Other things about me
:guitar: I am doing small projects for my music!!!! I can play many instruments. I played the instrument since I was young and I learned by myself through YT etc. without any courses. I can play jazz, pop, rock, metal anything that I interested in. \
:headphones: I listen to a variety of music genres, but I like some heavy and sad taste. So, I love metal songs.
:heavy_minus_sign: I am quite a sensitive and negative guy because of my music favorite I guess. I can be positive just let me play an instrument!!!! \
:star: Sometimes, I feel like I have a big goal to be successful from my imagination. \
:man: I am a lonely guy, but I am quite friendly as well. If anyone wants to help, I am willing to be a support to anyone if I can. \

"No one is perfect, but If you want something. You can be if you don't dive into your negative feelings too much Keep going!!!!"
